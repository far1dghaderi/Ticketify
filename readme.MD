#### It needs your cooperation

Since that i'm not a UI/UX designer I think it's design is a disaster, not a disaster actually :) but it's not that good and it really need some improvments.

- [ ] Some changes in design

Because of my lack of time I just skip some features like:

- In a real senario, admins must see the tickets details such as User's name, ID , etc to authenticate it, but because it was just a repetitive code and design I just skipped it.
  &nbsp;
- [ ] Ticket details page
      &nbsp;

- It's not responsive
  &nbsp;
- [ ] Do some CSS
      &nbsp;

- for same reason, You can't see all of users details in admin panel, It's just a summary.
  &nbsp;

- [ ] Users Details
      &nbsp;

- It would be nice if we can set coupons for users
  &nbsp;
- [ ] Users Details
      &nbsp;

I'll be so glad to see your reviews about my code guys :) That was the main reason that I created Ticketify as my first Nodejs website.
